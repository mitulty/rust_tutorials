# ðŸ¦€ Rust Tutorials

Welcome to the **Rust Tutorials** repository! This collection is designed to help you learn and master the Rust programming language through hands-on examples and well-structured lessons.

This repository contains a series of tutorials and example projects that cover topics such as:

- âœ… Basic syntax and concepts (variables, functions, ownership, borrowing)  
- âœ… Control flow and pattern matching  
- âœ… Structs, Enums, and Traits  
- âœ… Modules and Crates  
- âœ… Error handling  
- âœ… Working with Collections  
- âœ… Concurrency in Rust  
- âœ… Integrating with external crates  

Each topic is organized in its own folder with source code and, when applicable, explanations in comments or markdown.

Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mitulty/rust_tutorials
cd rust-tutorials
```
